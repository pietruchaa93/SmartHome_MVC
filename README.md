# SmartHome_MVC
My application SmartHome write in MVC.


My own concept for a "Smart Home" application. The application mainly downloads data from the Arduino Leonardo, where there is a code in C ++, sending information in JSON format about the current temperature, states of two buttons and analog output values. Source of code: https://github.com/pietruchaa93/Arduino_Read_Value 
Communication takes place via the serial port. All data is stored in the SQL Lite database.
